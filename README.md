# VehicleShowroom_Management

I did the project on VehicleShowroom_management in which i created a folder VehicleShowroom.
<br></br>
within that i created folder public.
In the public folder i have created files called,
1. index.html
2. login.html
3. login.js
4. scripts.js
5. styles.css,


Outside the public folder, I have created another file named
1.server.js
Which connects html files and js files.
-> create a database called VehicleShowroom in MySQL or any SQL language.
-> In that database create tables - Bikes, Sales, Customers, Service, etc.
-> Insert some values for all the tables we have created.
